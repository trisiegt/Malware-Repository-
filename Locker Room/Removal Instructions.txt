You just got infected with the Locker Room virus.
Here's how to remove it.

Step 1: Boot into a PE
If you don't know what a Windows PE is, it stands for "Microsoft Windows Preinstallation Environment".
It is basically a complete Windows installation, but it's loaded into RAM. For beginners, I would recommend using "Hiren's BootCD PE", but I use my own custom PE.

Step 2: Open the command prompt
Open the Start Menu, and then the Windows System folder. (Hint: It may be called System Tools.)
Then, click on Command Prompt.

Step 3: Remove virus files
In the Command Prompt, type "explorer" .
In explorer (File Explorer/Windows Explorer), click on This PC/Computer, if it is not already selected.
Double-click the drive with the text "Windows" or "Local Disk".
At the top, where it says "View", click on it, and then "Hidden items" (IF you already have the box checked for "Hidden items", then skip this step).
Then, in the explorer itself, double-click on "ProgramData>Microsoft>Windows>Start Menu>Programs>Startup"
Then, delete "lock.vbs".
Then, go to the root directory of the drive, and delete the "qwerty" folder reboot.
In your normal Windows installation, log in and navigate to where the virus files are located, and delete the folder that they are located in.
Then, open regedit (Registry Editor), and locate to HKLM\SOFTWARE, and delete the key named "Trisiegt"

Step 5: Restore your theme
Restore your theme to how it was beforehand.
